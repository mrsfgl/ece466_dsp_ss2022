Course Description and Policies 
=

This course introduces fundamental tools for extracting information 
embedded in digital signals. While most real world signals are inherently analog, digital signal processing is often performed (after analog-to-digital conversion) due to the cost effectiveness, reliability, and re-configurability of digital hardware and software. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques will specifically be presented in both the time-domain and frequency-domain to analyze signals and linear and time-invariant (LTI) systems, and determine the output response of such systems to input signals. To supplement this theory, practical experience in analyzing and processing digital signals will be provided through a computer project based on Python. Digital signal processing is needed in virtually all aspects of science and engineering. Applications of digital signal processing include the study of physiologic systems and financial markets as well as the design of control and communication systems.

__Requirements:__ There will be two midterms, homeworks, quizzes, and a final project.
1. __Midterm 1:__
