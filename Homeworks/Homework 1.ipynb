    "* You can collaborate on homeworks and turn in a homework for 2 people.\n",
    "* You start with 12 bonus points. Think of it as me giving you points for researching markdown, jupyter notebooks, etc.\n",
    "* Include your codes and answers within the cells that are requested. Do not create additional cells. \n",
    "* Double click on any cell to see the raw text that generates it. `shift+enter` runs a cell and shows you an output. Feel free to play with it but please return the question and description cells in the original format.\n",
    "* You can find markdown tutorials and guides by simple google search. Cheatsheets should be more useful if you are short on time.\n",
    "* Ask your questions in the [discussion forums in D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/1382712/discussions/List). You can post in homework or coding related. If it's not specific to this homework $\\rightarrow$ Coding Related.\n",
